# Recoil
A state management library for React。
recoil是react的状态管理库，他具备三大特点。

### Minimal and Reactish
Recoil works and thinks like React. Add some to your app and get fast and flexible shared state.

### Data-Flow Graph
Derived data and asynchronous queries are tamed with pure functions and efficient subscriptions.

### Cross-App Observation
Implement persistence, routing, time-travel debugging, or undo by observing all state changes across your app, without impairing code-splitting.
