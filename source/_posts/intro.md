This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2019 Language. It is the tenth edition of the ECMAScript Language Specification. Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most widely used general-purpose programming languages. It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications.
ECMA标准定义了ECMAScript 2019语言。它是ECMAScript语言规范自1997年出版以来的第十个版本。ECMAScript已经成长为全世界通用程序设计语言运用最广泛之一。它因嵌入web浏览器且同时也能被广泛的运用于服务端和嵌入式应用程序而被众人所熟知。

ECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.
ECMAScript是基于几种较早的技术，其中最被人熟知的是Javascript（Netscape）和JScript(Microsoft).这们语言是被Netscape公司的Brendan Eich所发明。它第一次出现是在NetScape公司的Navigator 2.0 浏览器中。它同样也出现在了所有的Netscape公司随后发布的浏览器中和所有的微软公司发布的IE3.0版本的浏览器中。

The development of the ECMAScript Language Specification started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.
ECMAScript语言标准的更新是开始于1996年11月，ECMAScript语言标准的第一个版本是在1996年6月被Ecma General Assembly所采用。

That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature.
ECMA标准被快速提交到国际标准化组织并迅速被采用，并且在1998年四月被批准为ISO/IEC 16262 国际标准。在1998年6月Ecma General Assembly批准了ECMA-262版本并且保持完全的符合ISO/IEC 16262标准。从版本一到版本二的更新也就顺其自然了。

The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002.
ECMA标准的第三个版本介绍了强大的正则表达式。更友好的字符串处理方式，新的结构语句，try/catch异常处理，严格的错误定义，格式化数值输出，以及未来的该语言未来的微小变化。ECMAScript标准的第三个版本在1999年12月被Ecma General Assembly采用，并且在2002年6月作为ISO/IEC 16262:2002发布。

After publication of the third edition, ECMAScript achieved massive adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. However, that work was not completed and not published as the fourth edition of ECMAScript but some of it was incorporated into the development of the sixth edition.
在第三版本发布之后，ECMAScript在连接万维网领域被广泛采用，且成为了被所有主流浏览器支持的程序设计语言。这在ECMAScript第四版本的开发具有重要意义。然后，ECMAScript第四版本并没有完成，更没有发布。但是，其中的一些内容被放入了ECMAScript第六版本的开发中。

The fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5th edition) codified de facto interpretations of the language specification that have become common among browser implementations and added support for new features that had emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include accessor properties, reflective creation and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security. The fifth edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 2009.
ECMAScript的第五版(发布为ECMA-262第五版)对语言规范的实际解释进行了编码，这些解释在浏览器实现中已经变得很常见，并且增加了对第三版发布以来出现的新特性的支持。这些特性包括访问器属性、对象的反射创建和检查、属性的程序控制、额外的数组操作函数、对JSON对象编码格式的支持，以及提供增强错误检查和程序安全性的严格模式。在2009年12月第五版本正式被Ecma General Assembly采纳。

The fifth edition was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262:2011. Edition 5.1 of the ECMAScript Standard incorporated minor corrections and is the same text as ISO/IEC 16262:2011. The 5.1 Edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 2011.
第五版本被作为国际标准被提交到 ISO/IEC JTC 1，并被迅速采纳。 其中ECMAScript5.1版本标准做了微小到调整并也被作为ISO/IEC 16262:2011国际标准。在2011年6月ECMAScript正式被Ecma General Assembly采用。

Focused development of the sixth edition started in 2009, as the fifth edition was being prepared for publication. However, this was preceded by significant experimentation and language enhancement design efforts dating to the publication of the third edition in 1999. In a very real sense, the completion of the sixth edition is the culmination of a fifteen year effort. The goals for this addition included providing better support for large applications, library creation, and for use of ECMAScript as a compilation target for other languages. Some of its major enhancements included modules, class declarations, lexical block scoping, iterators and generators, promises for asynchronous programming, destructuring patterns, and proper tail calls. The ECMAScript library of built-ins was expanded to support additional data abstractions including maps, sets, and arrays of binary numeric values as well as additional support for Unicode supplemental characters in strings and regular expressions. The built-ins were also made extensible via subclassing. The sixth edition provides the foundation for regular, incremental language and library enhancements. The sixth edition was adopted by the General Assembly of June 2015.
ECMAScript第六版的重点开发是开始于2009年，这也是第五版准备公布的时候。然后，在此之前，从1999年第三版出版的时候开始，就进行了大量的实验和语言增强设计工作。从某种意义上讲，第六版的完成是15年来努力的高潮。这主要包括支持大型应用程序，库创建和使用ECMAScript作为其他语言的编译目标。它的一些主要增强包括模块、类声明、词法块范围、迭代器和生成器、异步编程承诺、析构模式和适当的尾部调用。ECMAScript内建库得到了扩展，以支持额外的数据抽象，包括二进制数值的映射、集和数组，以及对字符串和正则表达式中的Unicode补充字符的额外支持。内建函数也可以通过子类扩展。第六版为常规的增量语言和库增强提供了基础。大会于2015年6月通过了第六版。

ECMAScript 2016 was the first ECMAScript edition released under Ecma TC39's new yearly release cadence and open development process. A plain-text source document was built from the ECMAScript 2015 source document to serve as the base for further development entirely on GitHub. Over the year of this standard's development, hundreds of pull requests and issues were filed representing thousands of bug fixes, editorial fixes and other improvements. Additionally, numerous software tools were developed to aid in this effort including Ecmarkup, Ecmarkdown, and Grammarkdown. ES2016 also included support for a new exponentiation operator and adds a new method to Array.prototype called includes.
ECMAScript 2016是在Ecma TC39的新的年度发布和开放开发流程下发布的第一个ECMAScript版本。从ECMAScript 2015源文档构建了一个纯文本源文档，作为完全基于GitHub的进一步开发的基础。在该标准开发的一年中，提交了数百个pull请求和问题，代表了数千个错误修复、编辑修复和其他改进。此外，还开发了许多软件工具来帮助这一工作，包括Ecmarkup、Ecmarkdown和Grammarkdown。ES2016还支持一个新的求幂运算符，并向Array添加了一个新方法includes。

ECMAScript 2017 introduced Async Functions, Shared Memory, and Atomics along with smaller language and library enhancements, bug fixes, and editorial updates. Async functions improve the asynchronous programming experience by providing syntax for promise-returning functions. Shared Memory and Atomics introduce a new memory model that allows multi-agent programs to communicate using atomic operations that ensure a well-defined execution order even on parallel CPUs. This specification also includes new static methods on Object:  Object.values, Object.entries, and Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors.
ECMAScript 2017引入了异步函数、共享内存和原子，以及更小的语言和库增强、bug修复和编辑更新。异步函数通过为承诺返回函数提供语法来改进异步编程体验。共享内存和原子引入了一种新的内存模型，该模型允许多代理程序使用原子操作进行通信，从而确保即使在并行cpu上也有良好定义的执行顺序。该规范还包括新到Object上的静态方法：Object.values, Object.entries, and Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors。

This specification, the 9th edition, introduces support for asynchronous iteration via the AsyncIterator protocol and async generators. This specification also includes four new regular expression features: the dotAll flag, named capture groups, Unicode property escapes, and look-behind assertions. It also includes rest parameter and spread operator support for object properties. There have also been many minor updates, editorial and normative, with many contributions from our awesome community.
这个规范(第9版)通过AsyncIterator协议和异步生成器引入了对异步迭代的支持。该规范还包括四个新的正则表达式特性:dotAll标志、命名捕获组、Unicode属性转义和向后查找断言。它还包括对对象属性的rest参数和扩展操作符支持。也有许多小的更新，编辑和规范，许多贡献来自我们了不起的社区。

Dozens of individuals representing many organizations have made very significant contributions within Ecma TC39 to the development of this edition and to the prior editions. In addition, a vibrant community has emerged supporting TC39's ECMAScript efforts. This community has reviewed numerous drafts, filed thousands of bug reports, performed implementation experiments, contributed test suites, and educated the world-wide developer community about ECMAScript. Unfortunately, it is impossible to identify and acknowledge every person and organization who has contributed to this effort.
几十位代表某些组织的个人在Ecma TC39中对这一版和前一版的发展作出了非常重要的贡献。此外，出现了一个支持TC39的ECMAScript的活跃社区。这个社区已经审阅了许多草案，提交了数千份bug报告，执行了实现实验，贡献了测试套件，并向全世界的开发人员社区传授了ECMAScript的知识。不幸的是，为这一努力作出贡献的每一个人和组织都是默默无闻的。
